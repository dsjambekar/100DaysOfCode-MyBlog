# 100DaysOfCode-MyBlog

Today is my first day of starting 100 days challenge. Or we can call it as 0th Day. Tomorrow will be 1st Day. TMI.
My plan is to have a blogging website of my own. Backend will be in ASP .Net Core. I have not decided about the front end yet.

#Day1
I created a solution in Asp.net core 5.0. Created an API to get all the blogs from MongoDB.
I am referring this article - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mongo-app?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio
Highlight of the day - How to save current timestamp value in mongoDb - ISODate()
